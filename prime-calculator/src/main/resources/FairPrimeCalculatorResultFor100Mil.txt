PS: Note here that because task was fairly allocated to all threads and no thread was sitting idle, time taken is fairly even
If we had allocated a set of numbers to each thread, say for example:
Thread 1: 1 to 1,000,000
Thread 2: 1,000,001 to 2,000,000  and so on
then, thread 1 would have finished before thread 2 and would be sitting idle because 1 to 1 mill will have lesser iterations
than 1 mill to 2 mill. This is unfair allocation of work and we have to be careful that we don't end up with such unoptimized usage
of multi-threading.
